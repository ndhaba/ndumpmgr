# ndumpmgr

A utility for organizing game dumps/ISOs.

I am making this because I have a lot of game dumps and I want to organize these automatically into neat folders by console, instead of by hand.

## Minimum Planned Features

- Organize game dumps based on console

- Import dumps stored as plain files, or common archive formats (e.g. zip, 7z)

- Automatically recompress game dumps on import to emulator-compatible formats (e.g. CHD, RVZ)
